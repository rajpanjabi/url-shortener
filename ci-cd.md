What is AWS CodeArtifact?
CodeArtifact is a secure, central place to store all your software packages. When you're building an application, you typically use dozens of external packages or libraries - things other developers have created that you don't want to build from scratch.

An artifact repository gives you a consistent, reliable place to store and retrieve these components. This gives you three big benefits:





1️⃣ Security: Everyone in a team retrieves packages from a secure repository (CodeArtifact), instead of downloading from unsafe sources on the internet (hello, security risks)!



2️⃣ Reliability: If public package websites go down, you have backups in your CodeArtifact repository.



3️⃣ Control: Your team can easily share and use the same versions of packages, instead of everyone working with a different version of the same package.
